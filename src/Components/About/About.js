            <p className='m-5'> I have recently finished BSC in CSE,And then I was strugling about choosing a specific goal , Then I found this course And got to know about the reputation of jhankar mahbub sir as an instructor,And I has some sort of interest in web developing even I had some interest in MERN before,But After enrolling in the course I found myself very much interested in react and everything,credit goes to the great jhankar mahabub sir and his team, And now my motto is finishing this course timely then getting a chance in SCIC ,doing some really good presentable projects. I feel myself a bit lazy these days, BUt I will start to change things in sha ALLAH.</p>
